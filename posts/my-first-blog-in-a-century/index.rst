HI Everyone.

Learn in a classical way:

Introduction to information retrieval (Manning[1])
Foundation of Statistical Natural language processing (Manning[2])
Those both books from Manning will give you base and cover all the topics needed.

Apart from that if you want you can cover a course of Natural language processing by Pushpak Bhattacharyya on nptel[3].

Now best way to test your understanding is build something.

Use python and other framework to build something using NLP techniques.

Example:

A sentiment analysis application
Document classifier
May be try with all of your PDF file and see if that worked well.
Or may be organise your bookmarks into refined categories.
Q&A Based Application
Bottom line is “Research in NLP is already rich “ and best way to reach up to the standards is to read other’s paper and try to implement it. For better understanding in sentiment analysis, please go through a very helpful case study here[4].

Good luck.
